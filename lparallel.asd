  :long-description
"
lparallel is a library for writing efficient parallel programs in
Common Lisp, featuring

  * a simple model of task submission with receive queue
  * fine-grained parallelism
  * asynchronous condition handling across thread boundaries
  * parallel versions of map, reduce, sort, remove, and many others
  * promises, futures, and delayed evaluation constructs
  * computation trees for parallelizing interconnected tasks
  * high and low priority tasks
  * task killing by category
  * integrated timeouts
  * vector-based FIFO queues

See http://lparallel.org for documentation and examples.
